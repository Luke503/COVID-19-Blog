                    <p>Being a student is already stressful in itself. Imagine during a global pandemic? Now that is a totally different story. The shift from in-person to all remote classes during COVID-19 has been extremly challenging for all of us students. Our
                        team wanted to create this blog to share our personal experiences with online classes and remote learning at Oregon State University and also share some advice we have on how to succeed. Don't forget to leave a comment and share your experience
                        as a student during the COVID-19 pandemic! </p>

                    <p> I remember getting sent home from OSU right when the COVID-19 news came out like it was just yesterday. I remember all my friends and I had barely any idea what was happening, but we all said goodbye and planned to see each other back at school
                        in a couple weeks. Little did we know, we wouldn’t come back to school until six months later. My whole sophomore year spring term was all online. I had to attend all my lectures on zoom and do all my homework in a place where I wasn’t
                        used to doing it at- my house back in my hometown. I personally struggled a lot with this because there were so many extra distractions at my house. I had a solid routine at school and had so many different resources and places to go to
                        study. All of that was stripped away from me in seconds. It was really difficult for me to stay encouraged and maintain my motivation to learn during a global pandemic. Life seemed so surreal at that time, and it still does. It’s been
                        really difficult to accept that remote learning and the way life is going right now is going to be the new norm for a while. </p>

                    <p> Looking back to the finale of winter term when COVID-19 had began to take affect on all of our lives, seems like just a few short weeks ago. When in reality, it has been a shocking 9 months since were packing our bags ready to leave campus.
                        I remember packing a small suitcase planning to head to my home in Atlanta for spring break, unfortunately news that students would not be returning to campus was released two days after I had arrived at home. I had to leave all of my
                        belongings and nearly all of my close friends back in Oregon, and face the struggles of online learning all alone on the other side of the country. Adjusting to this drastic change was an obstacle like no other, it took me nearly all of
                        spring term to put together a solid studying routine. And even with this routine, I struggled to set aside my personal life, stay motivated to perform well, achieve good grades, or even maintain a proper work-ethic. Although I can finally
                        say that I have adjusted to online learning, it still seems absurd to believe that this is really my life as a student in a pandemic.</p>
