        <p>Being a student is already stressful in itself. Imagine during a global pandemic? Now that is a totally different story. The shift from in-person to all remote classes during COVID-19 has been extremly challenging for all of us students. Our team wanted to create this blog to share our personal experiences with online classes and remote learning at Oregon State University and also share some advice we have on how to succeed. Don't forget to leave a comment and share your experience as a student during the COVID-19 pandemic!  </p>

        <h3>Personal Experiences:</h3>
        <h4>Hannah Maung, Junior, Computer Science Applied with Business</h4>
        <p> I remember getting sent home from OSU right when the COVID-19 news came out like it was just yesterday. I remember all my friends and I had barely any idea what was happening, but we all said goodbye and planned to see each other back at school in a couple weeks. Little did we know, we wouldn’t come back to school until six months later. My whole sophomore year spring term was all online. I had to attend all my lectures on zoom and do all my homework in a place where I wasn’t used to doing it at- my house back in my hometown. I personally struggled a lot with this because there were so many extra distractions at my house. I had a solid routine at school and had so many different resources and places to go to study. All of that was stripped away from me in seconds. It was really difficult for me to stay encouraged and maintain my motivation to learn during a global pandemic. Life seemed so surreal at that time, and it still does. It’s been really difficult to accept that remote learning and the way life is going right now is going to be the new norm for a while. </p>
