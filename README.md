Blog post

- Our blog post will be about the shift from in-person classes to online classes during COVID-19. Obviously, this transition has been tough for the majority of us students, so we wanted to draw attention to this situation. It will include the team membersâ€™ personal experiences, advice on how to succeed with remote learning, and a comment section where users can share their experience and give advice to other readers. It will also include data on COVID-19 cases and statistics like drop-out rates and the number of students failing classes before and when the pandemic started.


- We are planning to add data regarding covid cases at colleges within the United States. We are also going to add a comment section where users can provide their name and a summary of their experience of school during covid.
